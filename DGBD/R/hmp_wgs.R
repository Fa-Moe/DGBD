#' @details "The overall mission of the HMP is to generate resources to facilitate
#' characterization of the human microbiota to further our understanding of how the
#' microbiome impacts human health and disease. We are currently in the second phase
#' of the HMP. In this phase, the iHMP will create integrated longitudinal datasets
#' from both the microbiome and host from three different cohort studies of
#' microbiome-associated conditions using multiple ‘omics technologies. Each of these
#' study groups has engaged in providing new computational tools and integrative molecular
#' perspectives on microbial activity during dysbiosis. As a result of creating these
#' multi’omic data resources, the iHMP has opened up new opportunities for data integration
#' in the human microbiome.".
