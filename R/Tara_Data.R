#' @details "Tara Expeditions are global scientific voyages that probe morphological and molecular
#' diversity, evolution and ecology of marine plankton to explore how they are impacted by changes
#' in the Earth's climate. The first expeditions collected samples of marine plankton containing
#' viruses, bacteria, archaea, protists and planktonic metazoans living in the photic layer of
#' the world's oceans. These expeditions, which took place between 2009 and 2013, include Tara
#' Oceans: a global view, and Tara Oceans Polar Circle, both of which followed the same sampling protocol".
